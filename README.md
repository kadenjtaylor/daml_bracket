# DAML Bracket

### Usage
> daml start

### How do I mess with it?
- Create a `Roster` with a _judge_ and a list of _entrants_.
- The _judge_ can choose to `Bracketize`, which arranges the _entrants_ into a single-elimination _bracket_ and creates a `Tournament`.
- The _judge_ can advance the _bracket_ by submitting a `Report` to the `Tournament` containing the _index_ and _winner_ of the `Match`.

### Why should I play?
- The _winner_ of the `Tournament` is given a `Trophy`
